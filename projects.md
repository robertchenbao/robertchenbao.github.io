# Projects

I have worked on several projects, and many of them can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/robertchenbao?tab=repositories). They have mostly focused on three areas: general web development, machine learning (with both traditional approaches like regression and new technologies like LLMs), and community-level resilience against natural disasters.

Here is a (selected) list of them:

* [Early Warning System](https://earlywarning.cs.virginia.edu): A research project completed with Prof. Ray Pettit at UVA. It is a Django-based web app that aggregates and visualizes learning data. By doing so, it aims to help CS course staff members identify struggling students and help them in a timely manner. It is expected to be deployed in late 2023.
* [Using Dominating Sets to Block Contagions in Social Networks](https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10376914): A research paper about blocking contagions, such as emotions and misinformation, in a social network. This study is part of a broader project focused on enhancing community resilience against hurricanes and managing panics during disasters. Accepted to [the IEEE/ACM ASONAM conference](https://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/2022/) in late 2022.
* [GlucOverwatch](https://devpost.com/software/glucoverwatch): A Python program that monitors glucose levels of Type-1 diabetes patients. It was the winner of UVA's Hack4Health 2022's Best Health Hack track.
* [Twitter Analytic Program](https://github.com/robertchenbao/twitter-analytic-program/): A machine-learning web app that analyzes Twitter data on a given topic and visualizes tweet density and sentiment distribution across the US. It was the Best Overall winner of the Thomas A. Edison Inventor Fair in 2020.
* [Marketing from Media](https://edisonfairs.org/2019/01/30/2019-science-fair-winners/): A data science project on Twitter. I mined a 3.5 GB tweet dataset to analyze public perception of Tesla and its connection to Tesla car sales/stock price. It won first place at the Thomas A. Edison Science Fair in 2019 and 2020 and earned admission to Florida's state-wide competition in both years.
