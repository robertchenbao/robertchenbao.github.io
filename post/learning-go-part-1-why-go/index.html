            <p>I am currently learning Go language with the Coursera class, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started">Getting Started with Go</a>. This post is written based on lectures in week 1 of the course.</p>
<h2 id="an-introduction">An Introduction</h2>
<p>The Go <a href="https://golang.org/">official website</a> describes Go as &quot;an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build  <strong>simple</strong>,  <strong>reliable</strong>, and  <strong>efficient</strong>  software.&quot;</p>
<p>In my opinion, it does this job well though <strong>simple syntax</strong>, <strong>garbage collection</strong>, and <strong>support for concurrency</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>
<p>OOP (Object-oriented programming) is a paradigm that describes concepts using class. In OOP, Classes serve as templates. The programmers then build objects based on them. If classes are like blueprints, then the objects are like real buildings.</p>
<p>Different from common OOP programming languages like Java, Go does not use the term class. Instead, it borrowed a concept called  <strong>structs</strong> from C language. It removed concepts such as inheritance or generics. In short, Go's implementation is simplified. Hence, Go is much easier to learn. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9upVbGSBFo">interview with Lex Fridman</a>, Brian Kernighan, a professor of at Princeton, states it takes him a lot less time to accomplish a task compared to some other languages such as Haskell or Rust.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>There is a trade-off while designing a programming language: efficiency vs ease-of-use.</p>
<p>Every piece of software, such as Python, Java or Go, must be translated into the machine language of processors. This can be done in two ways: compile it, or interpret it.</p>
<p>The &quot;compiler approach&quot; means to translate instructions <em>once</em> before running the code, which will save time when the program is running. Hence, complied programs can often be extremely fast. But since compilers can be very picky, this type of programming language can often be difficult to code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the &quot;interpreter approach&quot; requires to translate instructions every time while the code is executed with an interpreter. With the interpreters, interpreted programming languages are easier to work with. They automatically manage memory. Moreover, programmers don't have to specify variable types (i.e. <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, etc.) The downside is the program will be slower.</p>

<td>Easy-to-use</td>
<td>Slow</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Go combines many features of interpreted and compiled languages. It is designed as a compiled language, yet it has many features borrowed from interpreted languages. Thus, it (to a certain degree) gets the best of both worlds.</p>
<h3 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h3>
<p>Concurrency comes from the need for speed.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, computers have been speeding up. With better processors, the software can even run faster without any optimization.</p>
<p>However, this came to a halt in the last few years. The engineers have reached <strong>a limit in producing microprocessors</strong>. If they put more circuits in the CPU, the CPUs will easily overheat the motherboard.</p>
<p>So, some software engineers came up with the idea of <strong>parallelism</strong>. That is, to add more cores of processors in the CPU, so it can run multiple tasks can run at the same time. But more questions arise: how to organize the tasks? how to distribute the tasks among cores? What if the tasks are interdependent?</p>
<p>Hence, to achieve concurrent programming, a software (i.e. a programming language) has to deal with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Management of tasks</li>
<li>Communication between tasks</li>
<li>Sync between tasks</li>
</ol>
<p>These problems are certainly not easy. However, Go managed to create a simple interface for concurrent programming. It has <strong>built-in Concurrency abilities</strong> that is both <strong>efficient and easy to use</strong>.</p>
