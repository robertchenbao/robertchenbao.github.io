# Personal website

This is the repo for my own website! 

It displays my contact info, social accounts, and past projects. Hosted on Github pages. See it online: [https://robertchenbao.github.io](https://robertchenbao.github.io/)

I built the site a customized version of <a href="https://sergiokopplin.github.io/indigo/">Indigo Minimalist Jekyll Template</a>, with improved font configurations and a more vibrant color palette.
