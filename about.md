<p>Hi! I'm Robert, a Computer Science major at UVA. Previously, I interned at <a class="link" href="https://callminer.com">CallMiner</a>, and UVA's <a class="link" href="https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/">Biocomplexity Institute</a>. I've also worked on several personal projects.</p>

<p>I like building things that help people with their daily lives. If you'd like to learn more about my past work/projects, check out my <a class="link" href="{% if site.resume-external %}{{ site.resume-url }}{% else %}{{ site.url }}/{{ site.resume-url }}{% endif %}">resume</a>!</p>
