Hi! I'm Robert. I am a Computer Science major at UVA, planning to graduate in Fall 2023. Previously, I interned at [CallMiner](https://callminer.com) and [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com). I have also worked on research projects at both UVA's [Biocomplexity Institute](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/) and its [CS department](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science).

Outside of the classroom, I help students practice for technical interviews three times a week at UVA Engineering's Career Center. I also love watching movies; some of my favorites are [Pixar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948372/) and old-school anime like [Studio Ghibli](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097814/).

I like building projects that have a tangible impact on companies and communities. If you'd like to learn more about the things I've worked on, check out [my projects](https://robertchenbao.github.io/projects) or my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertchenbao)!
